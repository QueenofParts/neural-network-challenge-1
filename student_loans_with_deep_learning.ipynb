        "Based on my answer above, I would say that the Context based filtering would be the way to go.  That said though, most students do NOT have much evidence of payment history or credit score because most teens do not get loans nor credit cards while they are living under their parent's roof. With this in mind, it may be worth trying a collaborative filtering model that is based on whether the applicants shared matching data with the past best payers.  \n",

        "There are so many things to consider here. Ethics is a big issue. Do your data and filter choices give everyone a fair shake? Are you unfairly profiling people? Is the collaborative filter model I mentioned above even ethical?  Is it a privacy violation? All data use would necessarily have to follow the current laws and regulations. I would also consider the shortcomings of the provided data potential problem. No system is perfect. For instance, the credit rating system is considered to be accurate though it does not consider where you get the money to pay your debt, only that you pay and do so on time. You could be temporarily using severence or inheritance to pay off your credit cards, artificially raising your credit score for a while. Creditors can be misled by this to extend loans or cards when you do not have a steady job or ongoing income. Another issue is changing situations. Tuition increases requiring bigger loans, interest rates rise and fall sometimes favoring the lender, sometimes the borrower. economic conditions such as recessions and booms also change the equation for loan terms and volume of borrowers shopping for them."
