# Student Loan Refinancing

by Marnie Brannon

I work for a comapany that specializes in refinancing student loans and I would like to experiment with some provided 
data to see if it can be used to predict whether applicants will repay their loans.

## Installation

To install and set up the algoythm: 
Download and run the file: student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb
you will need the following libraries installed to successfully run this code:

pandas
tensorflow 
keras layers:  Dense
Keras layers: Sequential
sklearn: train_test_split
sklearn: StandardScaler
sklearn: classification_report
pathlib: Path


## Usage

this code can be used to predict student loan repayment. Within it can be found examples of neural networks, compiling and evaliuting data, scaling, fitting, optimizing, predicting and evaluating the data results.

## Contributing

For this project I used the starter code provided along with the guidelines shown in bootcamp spot.
Some of my questions regarding problems with dependencies were answered by Simon Kingaby.
Alexander helped me to overcome problems saving athe file in step 4.
I needed to use AI to guide me through a few issues with creating a squential model and analysing the predictions.
I also used it to find some of the errors which often tended to be typing issues I hadn't noticed.


## License

This code is for anyone to use.
